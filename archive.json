That's some weird kind of forward secrecy assuming that skR and psk are stored sufficiently separated (weird because new ciphertexts are still created with the same key material, there is no key update, no transition to a new epoch, etc). I have a proof for this property within my analysis. I think it's a good idea to mention this in the security considerations section, but maybe it's already implicit with my previous text suggestion.\r\n\r\nA protocol building upon HPKE could try to add better properties, but I am not sure if this would be out of scope of this draft?",

      "body": "The isolated DHKEM cannot be proven IND-CCA-secure as it is: In the current Encap, nothing is done with the result of the DH operation, `zz`. This means there is nowhere where the GDH assumption can be applied, as for this we need a comparison of a value with `g^ab` in the game, like `g^c = g^ab`, which we can then change in a game hop to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem when looking at HPKE as a whole, because `zz` is fed into Extract which we model as a random oracle. For DHKEM isolated, this problem can be fixed by feeding the Diffie-Hellman shared secret through another random oracle before returning the result as `zz`.\r\n\r\nThe hash functions suggested in this pull request are chosen to correspond to the security level of the elliptic curve DH, respectively. If users of HPKE want to use only one hash function, then they need to choose the KDF depending on the used DHKEM. Specifying each DHKEM for multiple (i.e. different output size) hash functions seems overkill and like sending wrong signals about the security level of DHKEM.\r\n\r\nRegarding random oracle cloning: By introducing another call to a random oracle, which might be implemented by the same hash function, this becomes now more relevant than before. I think we need to make sure that Hash' and the calls to Hash inside HMAC are independent, to be able to use the indifferentiability theorem on SHAxxx. I looked at the input domains of these two calls for SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 and they are indeed _already disjoint_ by their lengths. An open question is if we need to do something about the Hash calls `Hash(pskID)` and `Hash(info)` that we model as collision resistant. I like to discuss this with Bruno and/or Karthik before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to keep you in the loop, please feel free to provide preliminary feedback.",

I don't think this conflicts with the stated goal.\r\n\r\nWe could also add the prefix to `secret`, it would have the same effect of binding HPKE's output secrets to the primitive name. In my view we chose to add the prefix to `context` because that's a place where we already add all the other context. Now that I am looking closer, the outputs of the three Expand calls are also not exposed by the protocol and thus can be considered intermediary values as well (`key` and `nonce` are used to produce ciphertexts, only those are exposed; `exporter_secret` is used to derive the actual exported secrets). That's why I would not comment on another intermediary value (secret), and drop this sentence.\r\n\r\nI think I can now express my weird feeling towards \u201cindependent\u201d better: the goal of binding the secrets to the primitive name is not assured by a security proof. I think we cannot prove that other protocols do not derive the same keys, because we do not have control over these other protocols. They could still derive the same keys on purpose. What we achieve by the `identifier` string is that the probability gets small that someone does it by accident. But we cannot get a guarantee like with `HashDH` and `Hash`, where we control both protocols. That's why I felt uncomfortable with \u201cindependent\u201d, because it suggests a more formal guarantee as it actually gives.",

I added the more or less same paragraph to Section \u201cDH-Based KEM\u201d because that is where DHKEM is actually defined. We can discuss if one of the two places is enough to mention validation.",
